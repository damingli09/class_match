## What inspired us
The pandemic of COVID-19 has a severe negative impact on the learning experience at school. Students have significantly fewer chances to know and to interact with classmates. Whereas websites such as Canvas and Piazza are useful tools for pedagogical purposes, an application integrating formal learning and informal conversations or discussions is missing. Based on such considerations, we aimed at building a website "Classmatch", which allows students to connect based on the common courses taken and to know each other better through academic or non-academic discussions in class chatrooms. 

## What Classmatch does


## How we built Classmatch
The application was built using the framework of Flask. User and class information was written to database using MySQL. The front end was built using CSS and Javascript.

## What's next for Classmatch
Apparently, fulfilling all the key features of this application is a big project and the vision can go more ambitious. The short term goal is make the fundamental functionalities more robust and more secure. Next, we would implement the chatting features and create metrics to monitor user interactions.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
This is a large-scale project and completing all the core functionalities apparently requires more time than a mere week. We knew this well in mind, and are proud to have established a rudimentary version of it under time pressure.

## What we learned
- Various technical skills for building a web application from scratch
- Project management (initial design, collaborative work, testing)
