## What inspired us
The pandemic of COVID-19 has a severe negative impact on the learning experience at school. Students have significantly fewer chances to know and to interact with classmates. Whereas websites such as Canvas and Piazza are useful tools for pedagogical purposes, an application integrating formal learning and informal conversations or discussions is missing. Based on such considerations, we aimed at building a website "Classmatch", which allows students to connect based on the common courses taken and to know each other better through academic or non-academic discussions in class chatrooms.
